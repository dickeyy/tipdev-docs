## First of all, what is tip.dev?
Tip.dev \{$} is a platform for developers to make money from fans of their products. We allow devs to create [public pages](https://tip.dev/dickey) that they can then link on their websites, or apps, or where ever they want.

Users of the developers products can then click this link and give small tips to the developer as a way to thank them for their work. Think of it as a sort of crowd micro-funding for platform but specifically for developers.

## Get Started
The first step is to [create an account](https://tip.dev/onboarding/signup) and follow the onboarding steps, don't worry there's only 3 steps. Once that's done, so long as you have connected your Stripe account, you can start receiving tips! Your page is instantly live, and accessible at `https://tip.dev/<your-username>`.

## Make it yours
Customize your page to make it feel like your own. Add a profile picture, a bio, a banner picture, and links to your social media. We are currently working on even more advanced customization options, so stay tuned for that!

## Share it with the world
Once you have your page looking the way you want it, it's time to share it with the world. You can link to it from your website, or your app, or your social media, anywhere you want.

As for how you link it, that's up to you. You can do the default link in your bio, or you can get creative and use some of our premade assets to embed it in your app, or website. Check out the [buttons page](https://tip.dev/dashboard/buttons) for more info on that.

## Get Paid
Once you have received some tips, you can access your [dashboard](https://tip.dev/dashboard) to see your earnings. Only the `tip` income type is enabled by default, and right now it is the only one that is supported. We are working on adding more income types, so stay tuned for that!
